# <img src="https://biodynamo.org/images/bdm_logo_large.png" alt="BioDynaMo logo" width="25" height="25"> Welcome to BioDynaMo on gitpod!

Gitpod is a remote cloud development environment accessed through your web browser. 
We already installed BioDynaMo, together with all dependencies and sourced `thisbdm.sh` to setup the environment.
Therefore, you can immediately start experimenting with notebooks, demos, or your own simulation.

## New simulation

To create a new simulation execute the following command in the terminal:

```
bdm new my-sim
```

&nbsp;

## BioDynaMo notebooks list

To open a list of all available notebooks, **[click here](https://8888-harlequin-bonobo-s9jyv8x5.ws-eu18.gitpod.io/?token=738632ffd4725a17eb0e025b0b65f06f33fd317f0703dbfcde93571d2cc95e5b)** or execute `open-notebook-window` in the terminal.

## BioDynaMo demo list

To see a list of all available demos, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
bdm demo
```

To try out a demo, execute:

```
bdm demo replace-with-demo-name
```

## GUI

You can also use graphical applications like ParaView. 
These applications are viewed in a seperate (VNC) window. 
If you execute `paraview` in the terminal, this window is automatically opened.
You can also open it by executing `open-vnc-window` in the terminal, e.g. if you accidentally closed it.
