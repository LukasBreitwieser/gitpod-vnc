# <img src="https://biodynamo.org/images/bdm_logo_large.png" alt="BioDynaMo logo" width="25" height="25"> Welcome to BioDynaMo on gitpod!

Gitpod is a remote cloud development environment accessed through your web browser. <br>
On this page, you can see the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor with the explorer on the left and the terminal at the bottom.<br>
In the cloud instance, we already installed BioDynaMo and sourced `thisbdm.sh` to set up the environment.

Therefore, you can immediately start experimenting with notebooks, demos, or a new simulation.

## New simulation

To create a new simulation, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
bdm new my-sim
```

&nbsp;

## GUI

You can also use applications with a graphical user interface like ParaView. <br> 
These applications are displayed in a separate (VNC) window. <br> 
If you execute `paraview` in the terminal, this window is automatically opened. <br>
You can also open it by executing `open-vnc-window` in the terminal, e.g. if you accidentally closed it.

If these two options do not work, adjust the browser settings following this guide: **[https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/browser-settings](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/browser-settings)**.

## BioDynaMo notebooks list

To open a list of all available notebooks, **[click here]({1})** or execute `open-notebook-window` in the terminal.

If these two options do not work, adjust the browser settings following this guide:  **[https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/browser-settings](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/browser-settings)**.

&nbsp;

## BioDynaMo demo list

To see a list of all available demos, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
bdm demo
```

To try out a demo, execute:

```
